# Phase 2 Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

Bot Battlr: Build and Manage Your Custom Bot Army with React

Description:
Bot Battlr is an interactive web application developed using React that allows users to explore a diverse collection of bots, customize their own bot army, and strategically manage their fleet. Users can enlist bots into their army with a single click, remove them as needed, and permanently discharge bots from service. This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in core React concepts, including component structure, state management, event handling, and data fetching from a mock backend using JSON Server.

The app provides an engaging interface for practicing and enhancing React development skills while offering a fun and dynamic user experience. Whether you're a developer looking to sharpen your React skills or someone who enjoys building virtual armies, Bot Battlr offers a compelling and educational experience.
